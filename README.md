Minecraft Hotel Plugin -  (1.20.2): A Full-Stack Java Solution for In-Game Economy & Management
This project showcases my proficiency in Java development and object-oriented programming (OOP) through the creation of a robust, in-game hotel management system for Minecraft servers (Spigot/PaperMC 1.20.2+). The plugin addresses a critical market gap by providing a modern, compatible solution where existing tools for newer Minecraft versions fall short.

Core Functionality & Problem Solved
Realistic Hotel Simulation: Replicates the full lifecycle of hotel room management within Minecraft, allowing server staff to define, configure, and manage hotel rooms, and players to seamlessly purchase and utilize them.

Version Compatibility: Developed specifically to support Minecraft 1.20.2, resolving the prevalent issue of outdated or incompatible hotel plugins for modern server environments.

Streamlined Management: Simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining in-game hotel economies, enhancing the overall player experience and server stability.

Technical Highlights & Skills Demonstrated
Java Development: Implemented core plugin logic, event handling, and custom command structures using Java within the Spigot/PaperMC API.

Object-Oriented Design: Applied OOP principles for a modular and extensible codebase, facilitating easy future enhancements and maintenance.

Data Persistence (YAML): Designed and implemented a robust data storage solution utilizing YAML files for efficient, persistent, and human-readable storage of room configurations, prices, and ownership.

User Interaction & Game Logic: Developed intuitive in-game mechanics for both server staff (room definition, content, and pricing) and players (room purchasing through sign interaction).

Development Environment: Leveraged IntelliJ IDEA for efficient development, debugging, and code optimization, demonstrating proficiency with professional IDEs.

Version Control: Managed the entire project lifecycle using Git and GitHub, including repository setup, commit history, and potential for collaborative development.

Dependencies & Prerequisites:
To run this plugin, your Minecraft server must be running on Spigot or PaperMC for version 1.20.2.

Looking Forward
This project demonstrates my ability to identify a need, design a solution, and implement it from the ground up, delivering a functional and valuable application. I am keen to discuss how these problem-solving and development skills can translate to real-world challenges.
